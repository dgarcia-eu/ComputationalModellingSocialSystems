# **Excercise session 1: Modeling segregation - Schelling’s model**

*(Please install Jupyter Notebook before the tutorial sessions takes place, where we can provide help with the installation if something goes wrong.)* The easiest way is using the [Anaconda](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) distribution, since it is well supported and maintained.

In case you have trouble following the given Anaconda installation tutorial or you get errors along the way, please consult the material in the [Excercise 0: Tutorial session](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems/blob/main/Exercise_00_Tut/Exercise_Tutorial.md).

**Notepads with solutions will be available after the submission deadline.**

## 2. Schelling’s model in Python with Mesa

In this Excercise, we will walk through creating a segregation model that is a classic of agent-based modeling, demonstrating how agents following simple rules lead to the emergence of qualitatively different macro-level outcomes. Agents are randomly placed on a grid. There are two types of agents, one constituting the majority and the other the minority. All agents want a certain number (generally, 3) of their 8 surrounding neighbors to be of the same type in order for them to be happy. Unhappy agents will move to a more happier grid space (if available). While individual agents do not have a preference for a segregated outcome (e.g. they would be happy with 3 similar neighbors and 5 different ones), the aggregate outcome is nevertheless heavily segregated.
