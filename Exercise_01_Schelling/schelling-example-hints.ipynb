    "# Mesa Schelling example - Schelling Segregation Model\n",
    "\n",
    "[[Code explanation]](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-mesa-agent-based-modeling-in-python-bcb0596e1c9a) **Note that the final interactive visualization part is optional**\n",

    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The Schelling (1971) segregation model is a classic of agent-based modeling, demonstrating how agents following simple rules lead to the emergence of qualitatively different macro-level outcomes. Agents are randomly placed on a grid. There are two types of agents, one constituting the majority and the other the minority. All agents want a certain number (generally, 3) of their 8 surrounding neighbors to be of the same type in order for them to be happy. Unhappy agents will move to a more happier grid space (if available). While individual agents do not have a preference for a segregated outcome (e.g. they would be happy with 3 similar neighbors and 5 different ones), the aggregate outcome is nevertheless heavily segregated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial model is a very simple simulated agent segregation. The rules of our tutorial model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are some number of agents.\n",
    "2. All agents begin as randomly placed on a grid.\n",
    "3. At every step of the model, an agent considers his surrounding neighbors to be of the same type in order for them to be happy.\n",
    "4. If an agent is unhappy, it moves the the unoccupied cell with maximal happines (if such happines is at least equal to the one at the current location); otherwise, an agent doesn't move\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, this model yields results that are often unexpected to those not familiar with it. For our purposes, it also easily demonstrates Mesa’s core features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use and modify the code\n",
    "\n",
    "These excercises are designed around a Mesa template that is given to you to reuse. You are not asked to perform any complex object programming, but instead we ask for understanding of the core features of the Mesa pyhton package. You will mostly have to modifly the existing template and code the ``Model`` and ``Agent``behavior using standard python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore, in this excercise, you are asked to fill your code where the comments state:**\n",
    "\n",
    "``#[Your code here]``\n",

    "model-level attributes, manages the agents, and generally handles the\n",
    "global level of our model. Each instantiation of the model class will be\n",
    "a specific model run. Each model will contain multiple agents, all of\n",
    "which are instantiations of the agent class. Both the model and agent\n",
    "classes are child classes of Mesa’s generic ``Model`` and ``Agent``\n",
    "classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### At the location ``# 1 Initialization [Your code here]`` you have to implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent has only two variables:\n",
    "- 2D position on the grid (x , y)\n",
    "- agent type [0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "(Each agent will also have a unique identifier (i.e., a position), stored in\n",
    "the ``pos`` variable. Giving each agent a unique id is a good\n",
    "practice when doing agent-based modeling.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### At the location ``# 2 Step agent function [Your code here]`` you have to implement:\n",

    "in the same order every step; their order might be shuffled; we may try\n",
    "to simulate all the agents acting at the same time; and more. Mesa\n",
    "offers a few different built-in scheduler classes, with a common\n",
    "interface. That makes it easy to change the activation regime a given\n",
    "model uses, and see whether it changes the model behavior. This may not\n",
    "seem important, but scheduling patterns can have an impact on your\n",
    "results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let’s use one of the simplest ones: ``RandomActivation``, which\n",
