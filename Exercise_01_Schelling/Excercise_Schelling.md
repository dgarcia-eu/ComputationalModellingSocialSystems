# **Excercise session 1: Modeling segregation - Schelling’s model**

*(Please install Jupyter Notebook before the tutorial sessions takes place, where we can provide help with the installation if something goes wrong.)* The easiest way is using the [Anaconda](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) distribution, since it is well supported and maintained.

In case you have trouble following the given Anaconda installation tutorial or you get errors along the way, please consult the material in the [Excercise 0: Tutorial session](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems/blob/main/Exercise_00_Tut/Exercise_Tutorial.md).

**Notepads with solutions will be available after the submission deadline.**

## 1. Simulations

Schelling's Model of Segregation: [[Simulation]] (http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/mccown-schelling-model-segregation/)

## 2. Schelling’s model in Python with Mesa

In this tutorial, we will walk through creating a simple model and progressively add functionality which will illustrate Mesa’s core features.
