    "# Mesa Schelling example - Schelling Segregation Model\n",

    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The Schelling (1971) segregation model is a classic of agent-based modeling, demonstrating how agents following simple rules lead to the emergence of qualitatively different macro-level outcomes. Agents are randomly placed on a grid. There are two types of agents, one constituting the majority and the other the minority. All agents want a certain number (generally, 3) of their 8 surrounding neighbors to be of the same type in order for them to be happy. Unhappy agents will move to a more happier grid space (if available). While individual agents do not have a preference for a segregated outcome (e.g. they would be happy with 3 similar neighbors and 5 different ones), the aggregate outcome is nevertheless heavily segregated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial model is a very simple simulated agent segregation. The rules of our tutorial model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are some number of agents.\n",
    "2. All agents begin as randomly placed on a grid.\n",
    "3. At every step of the model, an agent considers his surrounding neighbors to be of the same type in order for them to be happy.\n",
    "4. If an agent is unhappy, it moves the the unoccupied cell with maximal happines (if such happines is at least equal to the one at the current location); otherwise, an agent doesn't move\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, this model yields results that are often unexpected to those not familiar with it. For our purposes, it also easily demonstrates Mesa’s core features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use and modify the code\n",
    "\n",
    "These excercises are designed around a Mesa template that is given to you to reuse. You are not asked to perform any complex object programming, but instead we ask for understanding of the core features of the Mesa pyhton package. You will mostly have to modifly the existing template and code the ``Model`` and ``Agent``behavior using standard python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore, in this excercise, you are asked to fill your code where the comments state:**\n",
