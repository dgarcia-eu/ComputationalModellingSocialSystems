# Opinion dynamics outcomes

- **Consensus**:
  - Distribution of opinions in which the vast majority of agents agree on the same opinion


- **Chaos:**
  - Distribution of opinions in a population in which no apparent agreement group or structure can be identified (fully random)


- **Polarization:**
  - Bimodal distribution of opinions in a population towards the extremes of an opinion spectrum


- **Fragmentation:**
  - Multimodal distribution of opinions in a population into groups of high internal agreement and high external disagreement (multipolarization)

---

# Opinion dynamics modelling principles

- Agent-based modelling approach: 
  - internal state include (at least) the agent's opinion
  - interaction rules between agents are specified
  - these interactions cause emergent system properties


- No central authority: 
  - collective opinions, consensus, polarisation, cultural traits emerge without central coordination results depend on control parameters


- Reactive rather than reflective agents: 
  - no advanced cognitive process, only adaptation to environment (neighbourhood) by following simple rules

---

# Voter models of opinion dynamics

- Rate to change opinion depends on other agents:
  - neighbors (networks, spatial models)
  - randomly chosen agents (also called mean-field interaction)



- Principle: *frequency* dependent dynamics. Opinion change based on:

$$P(1-\theta_{i}|\theta_{i})=\kappa(f)\; f_{i}^{1-\theta_{i}}$$

- $\theta_{i}$: opinion of agent $i$
- $0\leq f_{i}^{1-\theta_{i}} \leq 1$: frequency of agents with *opposite* opinions in "neighborhood" of agent $i$
-  $\kappa(f)$: response function to frequency of other opinions
- Analysis question: How does the outcome depend on $\kappa(f)$?


---

# Linear voter model


- Dynamics: $P(1-\theta|\theta)=f^{1-\theta}$
- Stochastic simulation agents update at random on a grid
- Initially $f=0.5$, random distribution
- Results:
  - coordination of decisions on medium time scales
  - outcome: consensus as an equilibrium
  - How long does it take to reach consensus?
  - Simulation at: $t=10^{1}$, $10^{2}$, $10^{3}$, $10^{4}$
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=900, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/voter.svg")
```

---
# Observations on linear voter model

- In the time limit, always only one opinion exists
  - Consensus always appears
  - There are two "absorbing" states: all agents are either 0 or 1
  - The probability to reach an all 0 or all 1 consensus equals initial frequency $f(0)$

  
- Model limitations/drawbacks
  - very limited social/biological interpretation (remember Social Impact Theory)
  - what about coexistence of opinions? The reality is not always consensus


- Some interesting features for analysis:
  - Time to reach consensus (TTC)
  - Intermediate dynamics or dependence on grid topology/network

---

# Coexistence of opinions?


- Coexistence can happen for some nonlinear $\kappa(f)$
- Absorbing states can be destabilized with small random component in the linear case
  - small pertubation for $f^{1-\theta}=1$ ( for example $\epsilon=10^{-4}$)
  - coordination of decisions on long time scales
  - asymptotically: coexistence but non-equilibrium
  - Simulation at: $t=10^{1}$, $10^{2}$, $10^{3}$, $10^{4}$

# Including memory effects


- $\nu_{i}(\tau_{i})$: reluctance of agent $i$ to change opinion $\theta_{i}$
  -  persistence time $\tau_{i}$ (opinion was *not* changed) $\to$ "history"
  - reflects local experience with agents in neighborhood

$$\frac{d \nu}{d \tau}=\mu\, \nu(1-\nu) \quad \to \quad \nu_{i}= \frac{1}{1+ e^{-\mu \tau_{i}}}$$

- Decision dynamics: 

$$w(\theta_{i}^{\prime}|\theta_{i})=\left[1- \nu_{i}(\tau_{i})\right] f_{i}^{\theta_{i}^{\prime}}$$

- $\mu>0$: slowing down of opinion dynamics
- What is the role of $\mu$ in time to consensus (TTC)?

## Discrete versus continuous opinion models

.pull-left[
- **Voter models:**
  - agents are characterized by a discrete opinion (e.g. binary)
  - adopt other opinions according to their frequency in the agent's neighborhood


- **Bounded confidence models:**
  - *continuous opinions* $x_i$ (e.g. real number between 0 and 1)
  - agent interactions are randomised and conditional on the difference of their opinions

## The baseline model: pairwise bounded confidence

- Consider a population of $N$ agents $i$ with continuous opinions $x_i$
- At each time step any two randomly chosen agents meet
- Re-adjust opinion if absolute opinion difference is smaller than a threshold $\epsilon$
  - In other words: agents $i$ and $j$ with opinions $x_i$ and $x_j$ interact if:
$$|x_i-x_j|<\epsilon$$
- New opinions are adjusted according to
$$x_i(t+1)=x_i(t)+ \zeta \cdot (x_j(t)-x_{i}(t))$$
$$x_j(t+1)=x_j(t)+ \zeta \cdot (x_i(t)-x_j(t))$$

- $\zeta$ is the convergence parameter: measures speed of opinions approaching

.pull-right[
- qualitative dynamics mostly depend on the threshold $\epsilon$:
  - controls the number of peaks of the final distribution of opinions
  - The final expected number of groups is $\frac{1}{2\epsilon}$


- $\zeta$ and $N$ only influence convergence time and width of the
  distribution of final opinions

- Sometimes you can get "wings" of agents at the edges or stuck between major groups

# The Information Accumulation Model

- n agents with continuous opinions $y_i$ and the following opinion dynamics:
$$y_i^{t+1} = (1-\Delta) y_i^ t + \sum_{j \in \Gamma_i} \omega y_j^t (1- |y_i^t|)$$
- $\Delta$: measures how much agents opinions relax over time
  - In absence of interaction $y \to 0$ 


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=700, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Relaxation.gif")
```

- Diffusivity $\omega$: coupling of opinions between agents
    - Agents approach the opinions of others in their neighborhood
- Saturation $1-|y_i^t|$: limits opinions to interval $(-1,1)$

  - $m_X$ connections to neighbors in the other community
- Weak inter-community interaction (filter bubble effects):

# Community dynamics


Agent dynamics simplifies to community-level variables:
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{1}^{t+1}&=(1-\Delta) y_{1}^{t}+(\Omega_0 y_{1}^{t}+\Omega_X y_{2}^{t})(1-|y_{1}^{t}|)
\nonumber \\
y_{2}^{t+1}&=(1-\Delta) y_{2}^{t}+(\Omega_X y_{1}^{t}+\Omega_0 y_{2}^{t})(1-|y_{2}^{t}|).
\end{eqnarray*}

- **00**: no opinion in both communities
- **PP**, **NN**: consensus (both same sign)
- **PN**, **NP**: polarization (differn signs)

When $t \to \infty$ in **PN** mode, opinions follow this system of equations:
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_1&=(1-\Delta)Y_1+(\Omega_0Y_1+\Omega_XY_2)(1-Y_1) \nonumber \\
Y_2&=(1-\Delta)Y_2+(\Omega_XY_1+\Omega_0Y_2)(1+Y_2). 
\end{eqnarray*}

    - $Y_1 = Y_2 = 1-\frac{\Delta}{\Omega_0+\Omega_X}$
    - Exists when $\Omega_0+\Omega_X\geq\Delta$ (total diffusivity $>$ relaxation)
    - Always stable

# Summary

- The voter model: binary opinions model
  - Probability to change opinion based on opinions of neighbors
  - Linear voter model: consensus. Nonlinear model can have coexistence
  - Adding reluctance to change can speed up consensus
  
  
- Bounded confidence: continuous opinions
  - Interaction only when opinions are close enough
  - Generates consensus, polarization, and fragmentation
  - Asymmetry of thresholds creates one-sided splits


- Information accumulation systems
  - Interaction in echo chambers with relaxation towards zero
  - Polarization depends on intra- and inter-community diffusivity
  - Tipping ratio shows that more links can generate polarization

# Quiz

-  The memory effect in the voter model makes you more or less susceptible to change your opinion?

- Is the Information Accumulation System a model of binary or continuous opinions?

- If $\epsilon=0.2$, how many opinion groups can you expect in the bounded confidence model?

- In the base version of the bounded confidence model, can the number of groups increase during the simulation?

- In our online society, do you expect $\Omega_X/\Omega_O$ to be above or below 1?
