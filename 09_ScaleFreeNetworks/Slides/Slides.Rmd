# Reminder: Node degree

A node's **degree** measures the number of links connected to it. 

In undirected networks there is only one measure of degree $k_i$, which is exactly the number of edges connected to the node $i$. 

In directed networks there are two kinds of degree: 
- **in-degree** $k_{in}(i)$ that is the number of edges ending in $i$, i.e. $(j,i)$
- **out-degree** $k_{out}(i)$ that is the number of edges leaving from $i$, i.e. $(i,j)$. In the first network example above, $k_{in}(c) = 1$ and $k_{out}(c) = 2$.

In weighted networks, **weighted node degrees** are sums of incoming and outgoing link weights. This way there are two weighted node degrees, the weighted in-degree and the weighted out-degree.

# Degree distribution

.pull-left[

The degree distribution $P(k)$ of a network measures the relative frequency of degree $k$ among the nodes of the network.

In the example:
- $P(0)=0$
- $P(1)=1/5$
- $P(2)=1/5$
- $P(3)=3/5$
- $P(4)=0$

# Power-law distributions

- **Probability Density Function (PDF)**: $P(x)$ or $P(X=x)$
- Relative likelihood that the value of the random variable $X$ will be equal to $x$
- Power-law PDF: $P(x) = \frac{\alpha-1}{{x_{min}}} \left ( \frac{x}{x_{min}} \right )^{-\alpha}$  or for shorter: $P(x)  \propto  x^{-\alpha}$
- Look like lines of slope $-\alpha$ in log-log plots

# The scale-free property


Power-law distributions are of the form:
$$P(x) \propto x^{-\alpha}$$  
If we multiply the random variable by a constant, the distribution is just multiplied too
$$P(Cx) = C^{-\alpha} P(x)$$
**Scale-free property:** The shape of the distribution is the same across different scales of the variable

# Fractals and the scale-free property

- Fractals are scale-free: they look similar when you zoom in and out 
- Sometimes it is also referred as self-similarity

# Diverging moments

The mean (first moment) and the variance (second moment) of a power law $P(x) \propto x^{-\alpha}$ might grow with sample size.

- If $\alpha \leq 2$ the mean grows with sample size
  - The larger the sample, the larger the mean
- If $\alpha \leq 3$ the variance grows with sample size
  - The larger the sample, the values become more unequal and more disperse
- Figures: example with $\alpha=1.5$

# Poisson degree distributions vs data

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=500, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/PoissonVsInternet.png")
```

$G(n,m)$ produces Poisson degree distributions, not power-laws. Similar problems with the Watts-Strogatz small world model.


---

# The Barabási-Albert model

Mechanisms in the model:

- **Growth:** stating from an empty network, add one node at each iteration

- **Preferential attachment:** when a node is added, connect it to $m$ neighbors chosen at random in the network. Neighbors to connect are chosen with probability proportional to their degree. 

The probability $\Pi$ that a new vertex will be connected to vertex $i$ with degree $k_i$  is 

$$ \Pi(k_i) = \frac{k_i}{\sum_j k_j} $$

## Global information and referential attachment

Remember the preferential attachment rule: The probability $\Pi$ that a new vertex will be connected to vertex $i$ with degree $k_i$  is 

$$ \Pi(k_i) = \frac{k_i}{\sum_j k_j} $$

The preferential attachment rule of the BA model assumes that nodes have access to global degree information and choose proportionally. Especially you need to know the sum of degrees in the denominator

This is implausible for many social systems: new actors don't know the network connecting actors, new social media users don't know the number of friends of others, new school students neither, etc.

- Start with one node and grow one node at a time

- When a new node connects, it samples one node at random and connects to it

- Then it copies all edges to neighbors of that node

- Some versions copy only a random fraction R of neighbors

# Quiz

- What kind of distribution is the degree distribution of $G(n,p)$?

- If a network has a degree distribution with exponent 2.5 and we double its size, can we expect a similar mean degree?

- If Twitter follower counts follow a power-law with exponent 2 and Twitter grows to double its size, what can we expect about the inequality in number of followers?

- Under what conditions is preferential attachment implausible?

- What is the exponent of the degree distribution of the vertex copying model?
