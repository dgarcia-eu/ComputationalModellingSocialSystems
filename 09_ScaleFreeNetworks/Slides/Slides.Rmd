# Reminder: Node degree

A node's **degree** measures the number of links connected to it. 

In undirected networks there is only one measure of degree $d(i)$, which is exactly the number of edges connected to the node $i$. 

In directed networks there are two kinds of degree: 
- **in-degree** $d_{in}(i)$ that is the number of edges ending in $i$, i.e. $(j,i)$
- **out-degree** $d_{out}(i)$ that is the number of edges leaving from $i$, i.e. $(i,j)$. In the first network example above, $d_{in}(c) = 1$ and $d_{out}(c) = 2$.

In weighted networks, **weighted node degrees** are sums of incoming and outgoing link weights. This way there are two weighted node degrees, the weighted in-degree and the weighted out-degree.

- ER and WS fail to get degree distributions
- lack of growth and heterogeneity or preference in linking
- Growth and preferential attachment
- Degree distribution -> gamma=3
- Growth without preferential attachment (fig 2b)
- Preferential attachment without growth (full net)
- A.K.A. Simon model, rich-get-richer (age effect)
- Issue: global information

- Rules: connect to a random node, copy its connections
	Alternative copies fraction of R connections
- Phys Rev case (Fig 3)
- In-degree distribution as power law exp 2
- Fig 6
- Comment: based on local information only it generates power-law
