# **Excercise session 3: Bounded confidence - Opinion dynamics model**

*(Please install Jupyter Notebook before the tutorial sessions takes place, where we can provide help with the installation if something goes wrong.)* The easiest way is using the [Anaconda](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) distribution, since it is well supported and maintained.

In case you have trouble following the given Anaconda installation tutorial or you get errors along the way, please consult the material in the [Excercise 0: Tutorial session](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems/blob/main/Exercise_00_Tut/Exercise_Tutorial.md).

**Notepads with solutions will be available after the submission deadline.**

## 1. Simulations

N/A

## 2. Bounded confidence model in Python with Mesa

The purpose of this model is to present results about continuous opinion dynamics when convergent opinion adjustments only proceed when opinion difference is below a given threshold.
