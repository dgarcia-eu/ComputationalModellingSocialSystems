    "# Mesa opinion dynamics example - Bounded confidence model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We present a model of opinion dynamics where agents adjust continuous opinions on the occasion of random binary encounters whenever their difference in opinion is below a given threshold. High thresholds yield convergence of opinions towards an average opinion, but low thresholds result in several opinion clusters: members of the same cluster share the same opinion but do not adjust any more with members of other clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "What would happen if opinion were a continuous variable such as the worthiness of a choice (a utility in economics), or some belief about adjustment of a control parameter?\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this model is to present results about continuous opinion dynamics when convergent opinion adjustments only proceed when opinion difference is below a given threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale for the threshold condition is that agents only interact when their opinion are already close enough; otherwise they do not even bother to discuss. The reason for such behaviour might be for instance lack of understanding, conflicts of interest or social pressure. Although there is no reason to suppose that openness to discussion, here represented by threshold , is constant across population or even symmetrical on the occasion of a binary encounter, we will allways take it as a constant simulation parameter in the present model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analytical solution (possible for small values of the treshold d) implies that starting from an initial distribution of opinions in the population, any local higher opinion density is amplified. Peaks of opinions increase and valleys are depleted until very narrow peaks remains among a desert of intermediate opinions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The excercise model is a very simple simulated agent threshold model. The aim of the formal model presented here is the same: to predict, from the initial threshold values, the ultimate number of opinion groups. Mathematically, the question is one of finding an equilibrium in a process occurring over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore models concerning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Homogeneous mixing across the whole population\n",
    "- Mixing across a social network (visualized in the Appendix)\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules of our tutorial model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a population of $N$ agents with $i$ continuous opinions $x_{i}$ (e.g., N = 100)\n",
    "     - convergence parameter $\\mu$ [0, 0.5] (e.g., mu = 0.5)\n",
    "     - opinion difference threshold $d$ (e.g., d = 0.5)\n",
    "2. Initially opinions are randomly generated across a **uniform distribution** on [0, 1]\n",
    "3. At each time step any two randomly chosen agents meet (from the list of all agents). \n",
    "4. They re-adjust their opinion when their difference of opinion is smaller in magnitude than a threshold $d$.\n",
    "5. Opinions are then adjusted according to the formula:\n",
    "    - $x=x+\\mu\\cdot(x'-x)$\n",
    "    - $x'=x'+\\mu\\cdot(x-x')$\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, this model yields results that are often unexpected to those not familiar with it. \n",
    "The model is filled with a large majority of agents which have reached consensus around x = 0.5 apart from isolated agents which have “extremists” opinions closer to 0 or 1: the importance of extremists is the most noticeable difference with the full mixing case where such 'wings' can apear.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use and modify the code\n",
    "\n",
    "These excercises are designed around a Mesa template that is given to you to reuse. You are not asked to perform any complex object programming, but instead we ask for understanding of the core features of the Mesa pyhton package. You will mostly have to modifly the existing template and code the ``Model`` and ``Agent``behavior using standard python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore, in this excercise, you are asked to fill your code where the comments state:**\n",
    "\n",
    "``#[Your code here]``\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get started."

    "\n",
    "(Each agent will also have a unique identifier (i.e., a sequence position), stored in the ``unique_id`` variable. Giving each agent a unique id is a good practice when doing agent-based modeling.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Agents should also use the convergence parameter $\\mu$ and the opinion difference threshold $d$, but they are constants and can be set once in the model for the whole simulation (and subsequently accessed through e.g., `self.model.convergence`).\n",
