.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=400, fig.align='center'}

```
]
.pull-right[

- % matched couples for the case of preferring attractive partners

- Correlation starts low but raises pretty fast up to about 0.55, closer to empirical values than the matching attractiveness case

- **Main result:** attractiveness matching is not necessary for observed correlations

# Schelling's segregation model

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=350, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/RND.png")
```
]

.pull-right[

- Agents are aware of the fraction of similar agents in their neighborhood: $f$


- Agents are satisfied with $f \geq F$, otherwise they relocate to a position in which they are satisfied
  - $F$ measures intolerance


- Outcome: Segregation measured with Moran's I

]
.pull-right[

- 3x3 neighborhood (up to 8 neighbors), torus edges

- Boxplots of I after convergence in several simulations

- Moran's I stays low for low F values

- Sharp increase above two neighbors for F

- Substantial segregation for F>0.33

]

# Axelrod's culture model

.pull-left[

1. Choose a cell (agent) uniformly at random to be the active agent

2. Choose at random one of its neighbors

3. With probability equal to their cultural similarity:
  
  - Active agent copies a random feature of its neighbor in which they differed

- Key parameters: size, $F$ and $k$

# Granovetter's threshold model

.pull-left[
Net benefit =  benefit - costs

- Threshold to join: Net benefit is >0

- benefits increase and costs decrease with more people in the action (monotonic net benefit)

- weaker assumption: there is only one crossing of zero in the function of net benefit vs people in action

# $r_e$ versus $\sigma$ in Granovetter's model

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=500, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/STD.png")
```
]
.pull-right[

- Assumption: Thresholds follow normal distribution with $\mu$ and $\sigma$
- $r_e$: equilibrium number of active agents (simulation ended)
- $\sigma$: standard deviation of distribution of thresholds
- Number of agents is constant: 100
- $\mu$ is constant: 25


- Sharp increase in $r_e$ at a critical $\sigma$ value: phase transition
- Diversity-induced collective behavior
]

## Opinion dynamics: bounded confidence model

- Consider a population of $N$ agents $i$ with continuous opinions $x_i$
- At each time step any two randomly chosen agents meet
- Re-adjust opinion if absolute opinion difference is smaller than a threshold $\epsilon$
  - In other words: agents $i$ and $j$ with opinions $x_i$ and $x_j$ interact if:
$$|x_i-x_j|<\epsilon$$
- New opinions are adjusted according to
$$x_i(t+1)=x_i(t)+ \zeta \cdot (x_j(t)-x_{i}(t))$$
$$x_j(t+1)=x_j(t)+ \zeta \cdot (x_i(t)-x_j(t))$$

- $\zeta$ is the convergence parameter: measures speed of opinions approaching

---


# Final opinions vs initial opinions

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=500, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/basic3.svg")
```

]

.pull-right[
- qualitative dynamics mostly depend on the threshold $\epsilon$:
  - controls the number of peaks of the final distribution of opinions
  - The final expected number of groups is $\frac{1}{2\epsilon}$


- $\zeta$ and $N$ only influence convergence time and width of the
  distribution of final opinions

## Weighted Balance Theory and hyperpolarization

.pull-left[

 evaluative extremeness

# G(n,p) ensamble

- Probability of such G(n,p) networks $P(G)$:
  - $P(G) = p^m(1-p)^{(\frac{n}{2})-m}$ , for such networks
  - $P(G)=0$ , for non-simple graphs

# The scale-free property


Power-law distributions are of the form:
$$P(x) \propto x^{-\alpha}$$  
If we multiply the random variable by a constant, the distribution is just multiplied too
$$P(Cx) = C^{-\alpha} P(x)$$
**Scale-free property:** The shape of the distribution is the same across different scales of the variable

# Poisson degree distributions vs data

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=500, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/PoissonVsInternet.png")
```

$G(n,m)$ produces Poisson degree distributions, not power-laws. Similar problems with the Watts-Strogatz small world model.

# The Barabási-Albert model

- **Growth:** stating from an empty network, add one node at each iteration

- **Preferential attachment:** when a node is added, connect it to $m$ neighbors chosen at random in the network. Neighbors to connect are chosen with probability proportional to their degree. 

The probability $\Pi$ that a new vertex will be connected to vertex $i$ with degree $k_i$  is 

$$ \Pi(k_i) = \frac{k_i}{\sum_j k_j} $$

```
]

.pull-right[

- Degree distribution of simulations with $m=5$ for t=150,000 and t=200,000 (circles and squares, indistinguishable)

- Line has slope -2.9 in log-log plot

- The degree distribution in the BA model follows a power-law distributuion with $\alpha=3$: 

$$ P(x) = \frac{2m^2}{x^3} \propto x^{-3} $$

# The vertex copying model
.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=500, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/VertexCopying.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
- Start with one node and grow one node at a time

- When a new node connects, it samples one node at random and connects to it

- Then it copies all edges to neighbors of that node

- Some versions copy only a random fraction R of neighbors
