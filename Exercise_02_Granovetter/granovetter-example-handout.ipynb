    "# Mesa Granovetter example - Granovetter threshold model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Models of collective behavior are developed for situations where actors have two alternatives. The Granovetter's models treats binary decisions-those where an actor has two distinct and mutually exclusive behavioral alternatives. In most cases the decision can be thought of as having a positive and negative side- deciding to do a thing or not to, as in deciding whether to join a riot. And the costs and/or benefits of each depend on how many other actors choose which alternative. We may take riots as an example. The cost to an individual of joining a riot declines as riot size increases, since the probability of being apprehended is smaller the larger the number involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key concept is that of \"threshold\": the number or proportion of others who must make one decision before a given actor does so; this is the point where net benefits begin to exceed net costs for that particular actor. Different individuals require different levels of safety before entering a riot and also vary in the benefits they derive from rioting. A \"radical\" will have a low threshold: the benefits of rioting are high to him, the cost of arrest, low. Some would be sufficiently radical to have a threshold of 0%/0-people who will riot even when no one else does. These are the \"instigators.\" Conservatives will have high thresholds: the benefits of rioting are small or negative to them and the consequences of arrest high since they are likely to be \"respectable citizens\" rather than \"known rabble-rousers.\" Thresholds of 80% or 90% may be common, and we may allow for those individuals who would not join under any circumstances by assigning them a threshold of 100%. It is not necessary, in fact, to be able to classify a person as radical or conservative from his threshold, and one strength of the concept is that it permits us to avoid such crude dichotomies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning with a frequency distribution of thresholds, the models allow calculation of the ultimate or \"equilibrium\" number making each decision. The stability of equilibrium results against various possible changes in threshold distributions is considered.\n",
    "Stress is placed on the importance of exact distributions for outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Groups with similar average preferences may generate very different results. The models Granovetter describes, by contrast, take as the most important causal influence on outcomes the **variation** of norms and preferences within the interacting group. The normal frequency distribution is of interest here because we may take it to be characteristic of populations where no strong tendencies of any kind exist to distort a distribution of preferences away from its regular variation about some central tendency. Yet, the results obtained are striking and counterintuitive.     \n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The excercise model is a very simple simulated agent threshold model. The aim of the formal model presented here is the same: to predict, from the initial distribution of thresholds, the ultimate number or proportion making each of the two decisions. Mathematically, the question is one of finding an equilibrium in a process occurring over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rules of our tutorial model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are some number of agents.\n",
    "2. All agents begin with an engagagement threshold for joining a riot\n",
    "3. At every step of the model, an agent considers all other agents joining the riot to see if the proportion is above its own treshold\n",
    "4. If the agent observes that the proportion of other agents joining the riot is above or equal to its own treshold, the agent joins the riot; otherwise, an agent doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, this model yields results that are often unexpected to those not familiar with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use and modify the code\n",
    "\n",
    "These excercises are designed around a Mesa template that is given to you to reuse. You are not asked to perform any complex object programming, but instead we ask for understanding of the core features of the Mesa pyhton package. You will mostly have to modifly the existing template and code the ``Model`` and ``Agent``behavior using standard python code.\n",

    "model-level attributes, manages the agents, and generally handles the\n",
    "global level of our model. Each instantiation of the model class will be\n",
    "a specific model run. Each model will contain multiple agents, all of\n",
    "which are instantiations of the agent class. Both the model and agent\n",
    "classes are child classes of Mesa’s generic ``Model`` and ``Agent``\n",
    "classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s use a more advanced one: ``SimultaneousActivation``, which simulates the simultaneous activation of all the agents. This scheduler requires that each agent have two methods: ``step`` and ``advance``. step() activates the agent and stages any necessary changes, but does not apply them yet. advance() then applies the changes.\n",

    "- engaged - has the agent joined the riot\n",
    "\n",
    "(Each agent will also have a unique identifier (i.e., a sequence position), stored in the ``unique_id`` variable. Giving each agent a unique id is a good practice when doing agent-based modeling.)\n",
