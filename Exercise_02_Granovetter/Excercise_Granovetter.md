# **Excercise session 2: Basics of spreading - Granovetter’s threshold model**

*(Please install Jupyter Notebook before the tutorial sessions takes place, where we can provide help with the installation if something goes wrong.)* The easiest way is using the [Anaconda](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) distribution, since it is well supported and maintained.

In case you have trouble following the given Anaconda installation tutorial or you get errors along the way, please consult the material in the [Excercise 0: Tutorial session](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems/blob/main/Exercise_00_Tut/Exercise_Tutorial.md).

**Notepads with solutions will be available after the submission deadline.**

In this Excercise, we will walk through creating a Granovetter’s threshold model that is a classic of agent-based modeling, Models of collective behavior are developed for situations where actors have two alternatives. The Granovetter's models treats binary decisions-those where an actor has two distinct and mutually exclusive behavioral alternatives. In most cases the decision can be thought of as having a positive and negative side- deciding to do a thing or not to, as in deciding whether to join a riot. And the costs and/or benefits of each depend on how many other actors choose which alternative. We may take riots as an example. The cost to an individual of joining a riot declines as riot size increases, since the probability of being apprehended is smaller the larger the number involved.
