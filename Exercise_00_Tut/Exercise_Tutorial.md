# **Tutorial session: ABM basics in Python with Mesa**

*(Please install Jupyter Notebook before the tutorial sessions takes place, where we can provide help with the installation if something goes wrong.)* The easiest way is using the [Anaconda](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) distribution, since it is well supported and maintained.

In case you have trouble following the given Anaconda installation tutorial or you get errors along the way, please consult the links in the Appendix with additional explanation.

**Notepads with solutions will be available after the Tutorial session, so we invite you to participate and explore the code yourself during the session.**

## 1. Python crash course

The Python crash course is aimed at teaching programming basics in Python as well as the usage of libraries and handling of different data types. This part of the course is very brief and only introduces concepts that will be strictly necessary in later parts of the course. 

The content of the Python crash course tutorials is as follows: [[Download material]](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems/tree/main/Exercise_00_Tut/python_introduction)

1.1. [Python Exercise 00](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems/tree/main/Exercise_00_Tut/python_introduction/00_exercise): Introduction to working with Jupyter Notebooks 

1.2. [Python Exercise 01](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems/tree/main/Exercise_00_Tut/python_introduction/01_exercise): Using Python as calculator

1.3. [Python Exercise 02](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems/tree/main/Exercise_00_Tut/python_introduction/02_exercise): Lists, loops and tables

1.4. [Python Exercise 03](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems/tree/main/Exercise_00_Tut/python_introduction/03_exercise): Logic, conditionals and filters

1.5. [Python Exercise 04](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems/tree/main/Exercise_00_Tut/python_introduction/04_exercise): Functions, images and text

_This Python crash course has been adapted from lecture on "Daten Lesen Lernen" [GitHub](https://github.com/Daten-Lesen-Lernen/daten-lesen-lernen-lecture)_

The data sets needed to complete the tutorials can be found in the folder [data](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems/tree/main/Exercise_00_Tut/python_introduction/data).

## 2. Pandas crash course

In this tutorial, we will walk through functionality of Pandas library, neccesary for data transformation and data visualization.

The content of the tutorials is as follows: [[Download material]](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems/tree/main/Exercise_00_Tut/pandas_introduction)

2.1. [Pandas data transformation tutorial](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems/blob/main/Exercise_00_Tut/pandas_introduction/pandas_introductory_tutorial_data.ipynb): Using Pandas Series object for data transformation

The data sets needed to complete the tutorials can be found in the folder [data](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems/tree/main/Exercise_00_Tut/pandas_introduction/data).


## 3. Mesa crash course

In this tutorial, we will walk through creating a simple model and progressively add functionality which will illustrate Mesaâ€™s core features.

The content of the tutorials is as follows: [[Download material]](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems/tree/main/Exercise_00_Tut/mesa_introduction)

3.1. [Mesa setup](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems/blob/main/Exercise_00_Tut/mesa_introduction/mesa_setup_tutorial.ipynb): Introduction to setup Mesa package

3.2. [Mesa model tutorial](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems/blob/main/Exercise_00_Tut/mesa_introduction/mesa_introductory_tutorial_complete.ipynb): Using Mesa simple model creation

_This tutorial has been adapted from the Mesa package introductory tutorial [GitHub](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/main/docs/tutorials/intro_tutorial.rst). It has been purposefully simplified for the context of this course._
