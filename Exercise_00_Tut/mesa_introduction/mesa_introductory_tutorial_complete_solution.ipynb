    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "[Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) is a Python framework for\n",
    "[agent-based modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model). Getting\n",
    "started with Mesa is easy. In this tutorial, we will walk through\n",
    "creating a simple model and progressively add functionality which will\n",
    "illustrate Mesa’s core features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The turorial will be given sequentially in 4 blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The base for this tutorial is a very simple model of agents exchanging money. \n",
    "2. Next, we add *space* to allow agents to move. \n",
    "3. Then, we’ll cover two of Mesa’s analytic tools: the *data collector* and *batch runner*.\n",
    "4. After that, we’ll add an *interactive visualization* which lets us watch the model as it runs. Finally, we go over how to write your own visualization module.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also find all the full code this tutorial describes in the **examples/boltzmann_wealth_model** directory of the Mesa repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial model is a very simple simulated agent-based economy, drawn\n",
    "from econophysics and presenting a statistical mechanics approach to\n",
    "wealth distribution. The rules of our tutorial model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are some number of agents.\n",
    "2. All agents begin with 1 unit of money.\n",
    "3. At every step of the model, an agent gives 1 unit of money (if they\n",
    "   have it) to some other agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, this model yields results that are often\n",
    "unexpected to those not familiar with it. For our purposes, it also\n",
    "easily demonstrates Mesa’s core features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get started."

    "model-level attributes, manages the agents, and generally handles the\n",

    "## Adding the scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "Time in most agent-based models moves in steps, sometimes also called\n",

    "in the same order every step; their order might be shuffled; we may try\n",
    "to simulate all the agents acting at the same time; and more. Mesa\n",
    "offers a few different built-in scheduler classes, with a common\n",
    "interface. That makes it easy to change the activation regime a given\n",

    "seem important, but scheduling patterns can have an impact on your\n",
    "results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let’s use one of the simplest ones: ``RandomActivation``, which\n",
