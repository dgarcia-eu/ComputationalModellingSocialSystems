    "### Lists, loops and tables\n",
    "1. **Lists and loops**  \n",
    "  1. Create a list cnsisting of words (strings) that make up a sentence.\n",
    "  2. By iterating over the list with a ```for``` loop, print each word.\n",
    "  3. By iterating over the list with a ```for``` loop, add all the strings in the list together into a longer string.  \n",
    "      <font color='green'>**HINT**: You need to create a variable before the ```for``` loop, where the total string will be stored.</font>\n",
    "  4. Create a list with integers from 1 to 10 (including both 1 and 10). Print each element of the list. \n",
    "  5. Print only the odd numbers of the list, then print only the even numbers. Print only the first 4 elements, then only the last four. \n",
    "2. **Tables**\n",
    "  1. Read the table \"titanic.csv\" using the function ```read_csv()``` from the python library ```Pandas``` into a DataFrame. <font color='green'>**HINT:** You can download the \"titanic.csv\" file from the StudIP folder for this exercise (02 Übung). Then you need to upload the .csv file to JupyterHub using the ```Upload``` button (in the dashboard direct beside ```new```). It is advisable that you create a new folder called `data` and this data (alongwith all the datasets you will use in future) in that folder. To import a library (e.g. pandas), you have to import it using the `import` keyword.</font>\n",
    "  2. Display the first few rows in the table. Find out how many rows the table has. <font color='green'>**HINWEIS:** Use the funktions ```head()``` und ```len()```.</font>\n",
    "  3. Find out what each column of the table means. The column ```age``` is straightforward, but what does the ```sibsp``` column contain?\n",
    "  4. Compute the average ticket price the passengers paid.\n",
    "  5. **(Optional):** How many passengers survived?\n",
    "  6. **(Optional):** Create a list containing integers between 0 und 100 using the ```range()``` funktion and the ```list()``` function. Print the length of the list (use ```len()```). <font color='green'>**HINT**: When creating lists in this way, you _need_ to use the ```list()``` function on the object created by the ```range()``` function. This is because ```range()``` creates only a so-called \"Generator\", that then _can_ be converted into a list. Subsequent application of the ```list()``` function will convert the generator to a proper list. You can check that all these are happening by inspecting the result of each function using the ```type()``` function.</font> "
