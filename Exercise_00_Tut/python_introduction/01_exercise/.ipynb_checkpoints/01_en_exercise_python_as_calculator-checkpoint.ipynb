    "  2. Create a new notebook for this exercise: \"New\" (top right) $\\rightarrow$ \"Python 3\".\n",
    "  3. Give the notebook a proper name (e.g.) \"exercise01\" by clicking on the field at top left that reads \"Untitled\". \n",

    "  1. Write a program that outputs the result of simple arithmetical operations (```print()```). Use each operator (+, - , *, /, \\**) at least once. \n",
    "  2. Use more than one arithmetical operator in a single expression. Use brackets ```()``` to change the order of execution of the operators. \n",
    "  3. **(Optional)** Divide an integer with another integer, that does not divide the former. Display the data type of the result with ```type()```. Now round the result to integer (use ```int()```). Display the data type of the result again. \n",

    "3. **Strings**\n",
    "  1. Think of a famous scientist (from Göttingen, obviously...). Store the first name, last name and a text snippet regarding scientist in three separate variables.\n",
    "  2. Add the strings (concatenation) with the name of the scientist and the quotation to form a sentence. Store the sentence in a variable and print it. \n",
    "  3. Format the output with the ```format()``` function to form an understandable and readable output (use whitespaces and punctuation marks).\n",
    "4. **(Optional) Comments in code**\n",
    "  1. Write a program of your choice that uses each concept you learnt so far.\n",
