    "  2. Create a new notebook for this exercise: \"New\" (top right) $\\rightarrow$ \"Python 3\".\n",

    "  1. Write a program that outputs the result of simple arithmetical operations (```print()```). Use each operator (+, - , *, /, \\**) at least once. \n",
    "  2. Use more than one arithmetical operator in a single expression. Use brackets ```()``` to change the order of execution of the operators. \n",

    "  1. Think of a famous scientist (from Göttingen, obviously...). Store the first name, last name and a text snippet regarding scientist in three separate variables.\n",
