In the following, we would like to get you ready for working with Jupyter notebooks for programming in python.\n",

    "A Jupyter notebook is a simple programming environment that allows the user to put together in a single file structured text (with headings, tables, formulae...), visualizations as well as executable code. For example, [this notebook](https://ocefpaf.github.io/python4oceanographers/blog/2015/07/13/interactive_geo/) illustrates an use case for geosciences. Two great advantages for this are\n",
    "* we can administer the programming environment centrally and homogeneously (no need to install software on each of your PC, a modern browser is enough) and\n",
    "* you can directly modify and extend the teaching material any way you wish. \n",
