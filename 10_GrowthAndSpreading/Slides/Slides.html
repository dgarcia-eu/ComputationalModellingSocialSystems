# Collective Aggregation

.pull-left[
Traces of human behavior can aggregate at large scales

Example: Monte Testaccio in Rome

Made of ancient remains of clay vases (est. ∼ 53 Million amphorae)

Collectively produced by a large group of people

Individual contributions might be indistinguishable
(or irrelevant)

Examples of online aggregates: views in YouTube videos, ratings for Amazon products, searches for a term in Google...

Examples of offline aggregates: population of cities, number of people with a disease, number of people who bought a product...

## Properties of collective aggregation: The fat tail

**Fat tail behavior:** The existence of few objects with a very large aggregated size

- Fat tails can be seen in the probability density function (PDF)

- Using log-log scales, the Fat tail is easier to see

- The probability of extremely large events is not
negligible

## Properties of collective aggregation: The long tail

&lt;img src="Figures/LongTailSchema.jpg" width="550" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
Long tail behavior: The existence of many objects with a small aggregated size
- Can be seen in the size sequence, also known as rank-size plot
- Example with products: collective aggregate size is amount of sold units
- The long tail can account for a very large fraction of the total area of the curve

Songs in Rhapsody.com
- Song in Wal-Mart do not have a
long tail due to finite shelf size
- Songs only available in Rhapsody
account for 22% of the sales


Baby names in the US (1960-2015)
- A large amount of names is given
to very few babies
- The amount of babies per name
displays long tail behavior

# Long and fat tails


A long tail:
- appears on the right tail of the size sequence
- shows the existence of frequent cases of small aggregates

A fat tail:
- appears on the right tail of the probability density function (PDF)
- shows the probability of extremely large aggregates

Different but non-exclusive phenomena:
- A high head of the size sequence is a fat tail of the PDF
- Sometimes are confused in the literature!

#When aggregates change over time
Growth Process: The dynamics driving how size changes over time

Sometimes they strictly grow (e.g. total views of a video) or might decrease (e.g. social media users)

.pull-left[
We will study three types of growth processes for collective aggregates:
- **Additive growth**
- **Multiplicative growth with fixed age**
- **Multiplicative growth with heterogeneous ages**
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="Figures/treegrowth.jpg" width="400" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

# Additive growth

.pull-left[
An additive growth process has a growth rate that is independent of previous sizes:
$$    X_{t+1} = X_t + \gamma + \epsilon $$

-  `\(\gamma\)` is the growth rate (change in units over time)
-  `\(\epsilon\)` is the stochastic term (e.g. `\(\sim N(0,1)\)`)

The figure shows the simulation of `\(100\)` additive growth processes with `\(\gamma=1\)` and `\(\epsilon \sim N(0,1)\)`
]
.pull-right[
&lt;img src="Figures/linear_growth.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---
  

# Size distribution under additive growth

Additive growth processes produce aggregate sizes that follow a normal distribution:
$$ N(\mu, \sigma^2): P(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} exp(-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})   $$

.pull-left[
- The figure shows the size distribution (PDF) after the simulation of `\(10000\)` processes as in the previous slide
- Individual aggregation tends to follow additive growth
- For example: a persons height
]
.pull-right[
&lt;img src="Figures/NormalGrowth.png" width="300" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

# Multiplicative growth

Multiplicative growth processes have a growth rate proportional to the previous size.
It follows the following equation:

`$$X_{t+1} = X_t + \gamma * \epsilon * X_t$$`
.pull-left[
- `\(\gamma\)` is the proportional growth rate (\% change over time)
- `\(\epsilon\)` is the stochastic term (e.g. `\(\sim N(1,1)\)`)
- The figure shows the simulation of `\(100\)` multiplicative growth processes with `\(\gamma= 0.01\)` and `\(\epsilon \sim N(1,1)\)`
]
.pull-right[
&lt;img src="Figures/MultGrowth.png" width="350" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]
---

## Sized under multiplicative growth with fixed age
  
Multiplicative growth processes with fixed age produce aggregate sizes that follow a 
log-normal distribution: `\(lnN(\mu, \sigma^2): P(x) = \frac{1}{x\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} exp(-\frac{(ln(x) - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}  )\)`

.pull-left[

- Final size distribution in `\(10000\)` simulations with the same ages

- If `\(X\)` follows a log-normal distribution, then `\(log(X)\)` approximately follows a normal distribution

## Multiplicative growth with heterogeneous ages

.pull-left[

- Multiplicative growth the same way:

`$$X_{t+1} = X_t + \gamma * \epsilon * X_t$$`

- A Poisson birth process produces new elements at a constant rate

- In that case objects have heterogeneous ages

- Inset: vertical axis is log-transformed

# Power-law size distributions 

- Multiplicative growth processes with Poisson birth  produce aggregate sizes that follow a  power-law distribution:

`\(pl(\alpha, x_{min}): P(x) \propto x^{-\alpha}\)` for `\(x\geq x_{min}\)`, otherwise `\(0\)` 

.pull-left[
- Results of simulating `\(100\)` processes with `\(\gamma=0.01\)`,

# Novelty decay in online communities
.pull-left[ 
The three properties of online collective aggregation:

- **Multiplicative growth:**  Each new element in the aggregate can bring new ones

- **Heterogeneous ages:** Objects are produced in different moments of time

- **Novelty decay:** Growth rates are not constant over time, they decrease very fast

# Novelty decay in online communities

Novelty decay bounds growth lifespan: similar to fixed ages

Online aggregates tend to follow log-normal distributions
 - tweets with a hashtag, views of YouTube videos, Digg votes for links...

# Compartmental models in epidemics

&lt;img src="Figures/SIstates.svg" width="1000" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

[Modeling Epidemics With Compartmental Models. Juliana Tolles and ThaiBinh Luong, JAMA Guide to Statistics and Methods (2020)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2766672)

- Individuals are separated into *compartments* by their state of infection
- Individuals are indistinguishable within compartments
- Individuals transition between compartments when their state changes
- Not really Agent-Based Model: population or equation-based model

---

## The Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model (SIR)

- Three possible states:
  - **Susceptible**: not infected but could be infected and is behaving as usual
  - **Infected**: has disease, is contagious, and spreads disease
  - **Recovered**: not sick nor contagious any more

&lt;img src="Figures/SItrans.svg" width="800" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Transitions between states:
  - From S to I: infection from another infected individual.
  - From I to R: recovery from disease, death, or permanent isolation such that individual cannot infect any other individual.
  - Transitions happen with rates `\(\beta\)` and `\(\gamma\)` respectively
  
---

# Transition equations in SIR model
.pull-left[

$$ \frac{dS}{dt} = - \frac{\beta IS}{N} $$

$$  \frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{\beta IS}{N} - \gamma I $$
$$ \frac{dR}{dt} =  \gamma I$$
]

.pull-right[

- Susceptibles diminish as they get Infected ( `\(\beta I S\)` )
- Infected increase the same way and diminish at a rate `\(\gamma I\)`
- Recovered only increase from Infected
- Parameters are not just a biological property of the disease, also depend on density of contacts, treatment, quarantines...
]

The basic reproduction number `\(R_0=\frac{\beta}{\gamma}\)` is the mean number of new infections caused by a single infected individual.

&lt;img src="Figures/SIRcurve.png" width="700" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

## The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model (SIS)

- Only two possible states:
  - **Susceptible**: not infected but could be infected and is behaving as usual
  - **Infected**: has disease, is contagious, and spreads disease

&lt;img src="Figures/SIStrans.svg" width="800" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Transitions between states:
  - From S to I: infection from another infected individual.
  - From I to S: recovery from disease but reinfection is possible
  - Transitions happen with rates `\(\beta\)` and `\(\nu\)` respectively
  
---

# Transition equations in SIS model

.pull-left[

$$ \frac{dS}{dt} = - \frac{\beta IS}{N} + \nu I$$

$$  \frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{\beta IS}{N} - \nu I $$
]

.pull-right[

- Susceptibles diminish as they get Infected ( `\(\beta I S\)` ) and increase from infected ( `\(\nu I\)` )

- Infected increase the same way and diminish at a rate `\(\nu I\)`
]

- if `\(\beta \leq \nu\)`, the disease dies out and `\(I\)` approaches zero over time

-  if `\(\beta \gt \nu\)`, then `\(I\)` approaches `\((1 - \frac{\nu}{\beta}) N\)` over time

# Refresher: The k-core decomposition

The graph remaining after the cascade above is what is called a k-core

&gt; **k-core**: A k-core of a graph `\(G\)` is a maximal connected subgraph of `\(G\)` in which all vertices have degree at least k.

For any network, you can calculate its k-core decomposition as follows:  

- Start with `\(k_s=1\)`  
- Remove all nodes with degree less than or equal to `\(k_s\)` and their links  
- Repeat until all nodes have degree larger than `\(k_s\)`  
- Increase `\(k_s\)` by one and repeat until no nodes are left

The nodes and the edges removed for certain of `\(k_s=k\)` is called the **k-shell**.  
A **k-core** is the set of all k-shells with `\(k_s \geq k\)`  
Nodes have **coreness centrality** as the number of their k-core

## Network centrality measures in simulations

Which centrality measure is the best to find nodes that create large cascades?


Comparison of the role of degree centrality `\(k\)` and coreness centrality `\(k_s\)`

Average cascade sizes comparison:

`$$M(k, k_s) = \sum_{i \in \Psi(k, k_s)} \frac{M_i}{N(k, k_s)}$$`

- `\(M_i\)` : average size of SIR simulated cascades starting at node `\(i\)`
- `\(\Psi(k, k_s)\)` is the set of nodes with degree `\(k\)` coreness `\(k_s\)`
- `\(N(k, k_s)\)` is the number of nodes in `\(\Psi(k, k_s)\)`

# A closer look to cascade distributions

.pull-left[

&lt;img src="Figures/Mdists.png" width="420" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[

- `\(k = 96\)`
- `\(k_s=63\)` (orange) and `\(k_s=26\)` (yellow)

- Lower: same histogram in a random network
with the same degree sequence

- Nodes with low coreness have high chances of
creating cascades of negligible size (cascade distributions are not unimodal)
