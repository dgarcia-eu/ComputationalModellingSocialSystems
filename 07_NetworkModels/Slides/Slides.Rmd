Social Networks are models to represent individuals and the relationships between them. The minimal components of a social network are:  

- **Nodes** (or vertices), which represent individuals. These individuals are social actors, for example, humans, animals, fictional characters...
- **Links** (or edges) are relationships between individuals, for example, friendship, family ties, interaction, communication...

# Refresher: Representing social networks
<div style="float:right">
<img src="Figures/networkDirected.png" alt="Social network example." width=400px/>  
</div>
A graph or network is a tuple $G = (n, m)$  
  - n is a set of vertices or nodes  
  - m ⊆ n × n is a set of edges or links  
  - n × n is the Cartesian product (i.e. the set of all possible links)  

Edges are denoted as ordered pairs $(i, j)$, which means that a link points from node $i$ to node $j$. 

The example of the picture can be written as:  
$n = {a, b, c, d, e}$  
$m = {(b, a),(c, a),(e, a),(d, e),(c, b),(b, c)}$

# Random graphs

- **Networks** that possess a particular property
  - Which are otherwise random (e.g., fixed degree distribution)


- **Analysis** performed by comparing (two) different model network structures
  - E.g., non-scale-free networks vs. scale-free networks

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=650, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/scale-free_network.png")
```

---

# Random graphs

- **Measurements** of network data for (two) different structures
  - Mathematically
  - Computationally
  - **Statistically**


- **Behavior** of such mathematical models of (two) different network structures
  - E.g., dynamic processes on networks - interaction between nodes in a social (connected) network
  - Consensus, opinion formation models ...

  - Number of edges is the number of connections between all vertices
$$\langle m \rangle$$
  - Diameter of a graph is the largest finite distance between any two vertices
$$\langle l \rangle = \sum_{G} P(G)l(G) = \frac{1}{\omega} \sum_{G} l(G)$$
  - Degree of a vertex is the number of adjacent edges, **also known as $c$**
$$\langle k \rangle = c = 2 \frac{m}{n}$$

# Recap basics: Binomial distribution

- Binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$
  - The discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent experiments
  - Each experiment asks a yes-no question (boolean-valued outcome)
  - Success (with probability p)
  - Failure (with probability q = 1 − p)

- If $p = 1$; dependent of size $n$
  - 1-single component
  - Each vertex is connected to each other
  - **Giant component** - connected component of a network that contains most of the entire nodes in the network


- Most networks (should) have a large component that fills the network
  - To be able to perform the intended role

### Sensitivity of parameter $p[0,1]$ vs. largest component
- How the size to the largest component changes in respect to $p$?

  - Reality: Largest component suddenly changes for one particular value of $p$
  - **Phase transition**

- Most real-world networks show an average distance that is comparable to that of the corresponding random graph
  - But their average clustering coefficient is much higher


- Exploratory data analysis
  - Given the **observed** value of a structural measure in a real-world network it can be compared with the **expected** value of that measure in a graph in which the network’s structure is randomized
  - Any structure is tested to whether it deviates from the structure of some pre-defined model

- Increasing complexity, cliquishness, and gender segregation with age
  - Filled squares, girls; open circles, boys.


- It is well known that, in general, same-gender friendships are more likely than boy-girl friendships
  - Especially in primary school. 

---

# Social network example

- Conlan et al. compared the number of these edges with the expected one in a model where each child maintains the number of declared and received friendship declarations concerning the gender of the other child
  - The mutuality is still statistically significant in almost all cases
  - The effect is less pronounced than if compared with a simple directed random graph in which the gender is not regarded. 


- *Note that this can be modeled structurally by defining two different in-degrees and two different out-degrees, each differentiated by the gender of the other child*
  - The random graph model then maintains both types of in- and outdegrees

# Random graphs as null models

- In terms of statistics, the null-hypothesis assumes that graph $\mathcal{G}$ was produced by the random graph model
  - This null hypothesis is rejected if it is very unlikely that the model is true
  - The random graph model is also often called **the null model** 


- The **p-value** $P(G|\mathcal{G})$ itself, i.e., the probability that the observed graph $G$ was produced by some random graph model $\mathcal{G}$, does not directly give you the probability $P(\mathcal{G}|G)$, i.e., the probability that the model is true when $G$ is observed

## Summary

- Random graphs
  - Simple graphs with fixed parameters (vertices, edges)
  - There is an ensemble of networks that satisfy the fixed constraints


- Large networks where $n\rightarrow\infty$
 - Degree distribution of a vertex approaches the Poisson distribution
 - Clustering coefficient $C \simeq 0$ if mean degree $c$ is fixed


- Giant component contains most of the entire nodes in the network
  - Largest component suddenly changes for one particular value of $p$
  - Phase transition happens at $c=1$


- The null hypothesis assumes that graph $\mathcal{G}$ was produced by the RNG
  - Real-world networks' average clustering coefficient is high
  - This null hypothesis is rejected if the assumption is unlikely
