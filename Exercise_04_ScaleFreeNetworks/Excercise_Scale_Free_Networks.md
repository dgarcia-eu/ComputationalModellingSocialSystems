# **Excercise session 4: Scale-free networks - Barab치si-Albert model**

*(Please install Jupyter Notebook before the tutorial sessions takes place, where we can provide help with the installation if something goes wrong.)* The easiest way is using the [Anaconda](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) distribution, since it is well supported and maintained.

In case you have trouble following the given Anaconda installation tutorial or you get errors along the way, please consult the material in the [Excercise 0: Tutorial session](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems/blob/main/Exercise_00_Tut/Exercise_Tutorial.md).

**Notepads with solutions will be available after the submission deadline.**

## 2. Barab치si-Albert model in Python with Mesa

Small-world networks accord with some empirically observed properties of social networks. However, unlike small-world networks, many real-world networks have been observed to have scale-free properties such that some small number of individuals are very highly connected, while most are not.
