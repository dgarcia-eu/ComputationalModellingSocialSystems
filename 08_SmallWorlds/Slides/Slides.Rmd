## Milgram's small world experiment

.pull-left[

- 160 people in Omaha try to reach one person in Boston by mail to their acquaintances

- 44 letters reached the target with six steps on average

- Short path length as evidence of small-world

- However, some letters did not agree, are those paths infinite?

# Refresher: Network distance

.pull-left[

The **distance** between nodes $v$ and $w$ is denoted as $dist(v,w)$ and measures the minimum length among all the paths connecting $v$ and $w$. 

If there is no path between $v$ and $w$, the distance between them is defined as $dist(v,w) := \infty$. 

Example: $dist(b, e) = 2$ 

In directed networks, it might happen that $dist(v,w) \neq dist(w,v)$.

# Average path length


.pull-left[

$$ \langle l \rangle = \frac{1}{N(N-1)}\sum_{u,v} dist(u,v) $$


- Global metric for the whole network

- It makes sense when network is connected, otherwise $\langle l \rangle= \infty$

- In the example, $\langle l \rangle=1.7$

# Refresher: Clustering coefficient

.pull-left[
**Local clustering coefficient**:

$$C_i = \frac{2*t(i)}{d_i *(d_i−1)}$$

- $d_{out}(i)$ is the degree of $i$ (>1) 
- $t(i)$ is the number of pairs of neighbors of $i$ that are connected

**Average clustering coefficient**:

$$C = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i C_i$$

# Clustering versus small distances


- Triangles reduce distances: all nodes in a triangle are at distance one

- Clustering and short path lengths appear to be opposing properties

- Social networks have high clustering (lots of triangles), can they also have short paths? Is the six degrees observation a robust one?

** Research question: can a model produce networks with both high clustering and low average path distance?**

Additional conditions:
- Network is large ( $N \gg 1$ )
- Network is sparse, like a social network ( $\langle k \rangle \ll N$ )

---

# The Watts-Strogatz model

.pull-left[
- Start with a fixed ring where $N$ nodes are connected to $k$ neighbors in the ring

(example: $N=20$, $k=4$)

- For each edge:
  
  - With probability $p$: rewire the edge uniformly at random
  
(two versions: only one endpoint or both are rewired)

# Properties of the lattice ( $p=0$ )


.pull-left[

**Average clustering coefficient:**

$$C(0) \sim 3/4   $$
(tunable value of $C$ based on $k$)

** Average path length:**

$$L(0) =  \frac{N}{2k} $$
(very high path length, grows linearly with network size)

# Empirical versus random networks

Empirical network analysis of $L$ and $C$ compared to random networks with the same number of nodes and edges (null model, $G(n,m)$ )

| Network | $L_{actual}$ | $L_{random}$ | $C_{actual}$ | $C_{random}$ |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Film actors | 3.65 | 2.99 | 0.79 | 0.00027 |
| Power grid | 18.7 | 12.4 | 0.080 | 0.005 |
| C. elegans | 2.65 | 2.25 | 0.28 | 0.05 |

**Evidence of small world networks: empirical networks have average path lenghts close to random networks but much higher average clustering**

- $R_{i,j}$: propensity to connect of agents $i$ and $j$
- $m_{i,j}$: mutual friends between $i$ and $j$
- $p$: base probability to connect when no common friends
- $k$: average degree of network
- $\alpha$: exponent that defines curvature of $R_{i,j}$ versus $m_{i,j}$ 
  - $0 \le \alpha \le \infty$

## Summary


-  The small world phenomenon
  - Anecdotes and literature suggest that the distance between two random people in the world is not so large
  - Refresher: average path length and average clustering coefficient


- The Watts-Strogatz model
  - From a regular lattice to a random network rewiring with probability $p$
  - For a wide range of middle values of $p$, clustering is high and average path lengths are low
  - Empirical networks show this when compared to random networks


- Social small world model
  - Cavemen rather than lattices as regular network
  - $\alpha$ modulates shape of propensity to connect vs friendships share
  - Shows small-world behavior for an intermediate range of $\alpha$
